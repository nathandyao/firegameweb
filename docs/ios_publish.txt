Introducing Fire Safety Game for Kids, an immersive educational experience that dives deep into the concept of Defensible Space Zones!

Join our young heroes as they embark on an exciting quest to create a fire-resistant perimeter around their homes and protect their communities from devastating wildfires. Learn about the importance of adhering to the legal requirements of defensible space, including the newly mandated ember-resistant Zone 0.

In this game, based on the recent Assembly Bill 3074, you'll navigate through different zones, each with its unique characteristics and challenges. Begin at the home and strategically work your way outward, up to 100 feet or your property line, whichever is closer. Experience the varying intensities of wildfire fuel management and discover how reducing more intense fuels closer to your home enhances its protection.

Explore a wealth of information and practical techniques as you clear vegetation, implement fire-wise landscaping, and secure potential hazards within the designated zones. Engage with interactive tutorials and expert guidance to ensure a comprehensive understanding of defensible space principles.

Fire Safety Game for Kids goes beyond gameplay, empowering children with knowledge of the law, fire safety regulations, and the critical role they play in safeguarding their homes and communities. By fostering responsible habits and promoting awareness, this game equips young minds to make a difference in the face of wildfire threats.

Join the ranks of fire safety champions and embark on an educational adventure like no other. Download Fire Safety Game for Kids now and empower your children to become proactive protectors against the ravages of wildfires.
